# Temperature-Playground-for-LLMs
This is a python script to demonstrate how LLMs would behave with continues increase in temperature 
This script takes a generalized prompt from user then generates output that is given as prompt to the llm for subsequent rounds along with an increase in temperature 

This also served as my first test use for LLAMA3
Feel free to change the model id and try out other models
